# 1. Overview
<br>
### This study investigates how South Kyungsang Korean listeners perceive lexical pitch accents, H vs. LH, by looking at different theoretical approaches to the phonological representation of intonational contour (f0).

- **Autosegmental-metrical (AM)** approach: intonational contour can be defined in terms of f0 turning points such as H or L. 

- **Tonal Center of Gravity (TCoG)** approach: not only f0 turning points but also rising shape is important.

# 2. South Kyungsang Korean
<br>
- A lexical pitch accent language (e.g., Kenstowicz & Sohn 1997, Kim & Jun 2009)

- Tonal patterns of some words are defined lexically, while other tonal patterns are specified post-lexically.

# 3. Methods
## Materials
- **Target words**: three monosyllabic homophone pairs

```{r,  fig.align='center', out.width = "40%", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/joohj/OneDrive/바탕 화면/final presentation/images/picture2.png") 
```

- The target words are embedded in a carrier sentence: H+L  target word L 
---
# 3. Methods
## Materials
- **Filler words**: differ in either onset or coda from the target words 

```{r,  fig.align='center', out.width = "90%", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

## Materials
- Recordings from a female South Kyungsang Speaker

# 3. Methods
## Factor 1: f0 peak alignment

# 3. Methods
## Two-alternative forced choice experiment
- **Participants**: 

    22 South Kyungsang listeners (11F, 11M)
    
- **Procedure**:

    120 target words (2 factors (5 peak alignments + 5 rise shapes) x 3 items (/kan/, /pal/, /pam) x 4 repetitions) + 180 filler words = 300
    
    4 blocks in a randomized order using Psychopy

# 4. Statistical analysis
## Mixed-effects logistic regression models
### Peak alignment
- **Dependent variable**: 

    *responses* (H coded as 1 vs. LH coded as 0) 

- **Fixed effects** as continuous variables: 
    
    *continuum steps* (5 steps from earlier to later peaks)
    
    Random slope and intercept for *Subject* and *Item*.

```
    
  In the model, the *Continuum steps* for *Peak alignment* did not show any statistical significance (b = -0.09, z = -0.89, p <.001). That is, regardless of the timing of f0 peak, the listeners responded to all steps in the continuum as LH.
    
  The H response percentage for all the *Continuum steps* was below chance level (mean = 0.16, sd = 0.37).

  The H response percentage gradually increased from Step 1 to Step 5, which found to be significant in the model (b = 0.68, z = -7.61, p <.001). 
    
  The parameter estimates of the model indicated that a one unit increase in the *Continuum step* for *Rise shape* yielded a change in the log odds of selecting H tone by 0.68, with a positive difference of 33% in the probability of selecting H tone.

# 6. Conclusion

<br>
- f0 rise shape was found to be an important cue for SKK listeners to distinguish lexical pitch accents, H vs. LH, while f0 peak alignment did not show such effect.

- This shows that rising shape really matters in the perception of lexical pitch accent!

- These results support the TCoG approach rather than the AM theory.
